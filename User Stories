He contacts the owner and discovers features including the ‘Choose your Length’ and “Choose your HairStyle” tool are not functioning properly for users. 
6 Consumers have voiced this issue to the shop owner.

Kaitlyn cannot set an appointment for Knotless Braids, 
Jakira cannot schedule an appointment for Plaits, 
Nina cannot set an appointment for Stitch braids, 
and Robin cannot set an appointment for a Retwist and Ponytail.
